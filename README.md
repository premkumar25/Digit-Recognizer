# Digit-Recognizer
Digit Recognizer using Machine learning
#
#
Digit recognizer is a model used to predict the hand written digits.

I have used Decision Tree classifier in this model. You can use any other classifers of your own choice.
#
Note: I have used Jupyter notebooks in this model. You can use any other IDE of your own choice.
